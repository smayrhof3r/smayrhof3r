# About me
Experienced, ambitious, and highly motivated with 16 years of banking experience, throughout my career I have always had a passion for digital innovation and driving creative solutions. Looking for a new challenge and keen to build on my interest, I signed up for the Web Development bootcamp in 2022. I look forward to finding opportunities to further build and develop my skills in this area, and am always open to learning new technologies and taking on new challenges.

**ðŸ¤“ What I'm learning now**
- **Node.js and React.js** to improve my web development skills with a new tech stack. 
- **Digital Ledger Technology** I've just started the DLT Talent Program with the Frankfurt School of Finance, as part of a selective cohort of women identified as future talents in this space. I can't wait to combine my new web dev skills with DLT, to build some exciting and fun projects! 

# My projects

**ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...**
1. **London Jets Ball Hockey team site**, a website built on Ruby on Rails for managing the ball hockey's practice sessions and activities. The original owner has moved on, and I'm just about to get busy maintaining and improving this site. A great opportunity to work on an existing code base built by professionals, include payment functionality using Stripe

2. [Ethereum Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ethereum-and-solidity-the-complete-developers-guide): I have just started the DLT Talent Program with Frankfurt School of Finance Blockchain Center, and I'm working through a course on solidity programming and ethereum app building alongside this! 

**ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my completed projects! (Listed here with most recent one first)**
1. [triply](www.triply.world) : Here, I had the opportunity to lead a project group in the application of BDD and agile methods to design, implement and release into production a website for managing group travel. The resulting web application uses the Amadeus API for real-time flight data to propose destinations for travellers from multiple starting locations, optimised by either price or travel duration, and enables sharing of itineraries with other site members. It even includes the invitable gem for inviting users through an emailed link! ([repo](https://github.com/smayrhof3r/triply))

2. [artly](https://artly.herokuapp.com/) : Another great project I completed with my Le Wagon group, where I participated in the design, implementation and release of an art rental web application to production. Application enables members to upload and rent art for temporary use. Conducted stand-ups and sprint demos using trello, and managed code versioning via github. A great first introduction to coding as a group! ([repo](https://github.com/eyss1234/artly))

3. [jukebox using sinatra](https://github.com/smayrhof3r/jukebox-sinatra-sqlite3) : I was thrilled to be able to build a fullstack 'app' using sinatra, so I did the same here for the jukebox application challenge. While the original challenge was from Le Wagon (and focussed on learning SQL), I expanded on this by building out the CSS and including an API for youtube videos. This was also my first collaborative experience, with code contributed by @lambley

4. [cookbook using sinatra](https://github.com/smayrhof3r/sinatra-cookbook) : My first attempt at MVC using sinatra! The application lists recipes you have uploaded yourself (using a form) or searched and selected using a key word (importing recipes via web-scape from allrecipes.com). You can also mark the recipes as 'completed' if you've already tried them!
