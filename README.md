# About me
Experienced, ambitious, and highly motivated with 16 years of banking experience, throughout my career I have demonstrated a passion for digital innovation and driving creative solutions. Looking for a new challenge and keen to build on my interest, I signed up for the Web Development bootcamp in 2022. Through the bootcamp, I have not only discovered my passion for full stack development as an outlet for my creativity, but have also confirmed that this is an area where my eye for detail, perseverance, and problem-solving skills combined with my ability to engage, influence and inspire others makes me uniquely suited for a role as a fullstack developer. I look forward to finding opportunities to further build and develop my skills in this area, and am always open to learning new technologies and taking on new challenges.

# My latest projects

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
1. **Littlest Paws Club**, a dog walker's booking site. Unpaid and initiated by @lambley, this project is an opportunity to flex my new skills as a web developer and hopefully add a few more! 
2. **London Jets Ball Hockey team site**, a website built on Ruby on Rails for managing the ball hockey's practice sessions and activities. The original owner has moved on, and I'm just about to take over maintaining and improving this site. A great opportunity to work on an existing code base built by professionals, include payment functionality using Stripe

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my completed projects!
1. [triply](www.triply.world) : Here, I had the opportunity to lead a project group in the application of BDD and agile methods to design, implement and release into production a website for managing group travel. The resulting web application uses the Amadeus API for real-time flight data to propose destinations for travellers from multiple starting locations, optimised by either price or travel duration, and enables sharing of itineraries with other site members. It even includes the invitable gem for inviting users through an emailed link! 

2. [artly](https://artly.herokuapp.com/) : Another great project I completed with my Le Wagon group, where I led the design, implementation and release of an art rental web application to production. Application enables members to upload and rent art for temporary use. Conducted stand-ups and sprint demos using trello, and managed code versioning via github. A great first introduction to coding as a group!

3. [jukebox using sinatra](https://github.com/smayrhof3r/jukebox-sinatra-sqlite3) : I was thrilled to be able to build a fullstack 'app' using sinatra, so I did the same here for the jukebox application challenge. While the original challenge was from Le Wagon (and focussed on learning SQL), I expanded on this by building out the CSS and including an API for youtube videos. This was also my first collaborative experience, with code contributed by @lambley

4. [cookbook using sinatra](https://github.com/smayrhof3r/sinatra-cookbook) : My first attempt at MVC using sinatra! The application lists recipes you have uploaded yourself (using a form) or searched and selected using a key word (importing recipes via web-scape from allrecipes.com). You can also mark the recipes as 'completed' if you've already tried them!
